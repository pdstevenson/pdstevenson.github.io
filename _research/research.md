## Nuclear Structure and Reactions

With PhD students Isaac Hobday; Khlood Al-Harthi; Lance Li; Jane Rex and with many collaborators

Atomic nuclei are made up of protons and neutrons.  Understand nuclear properties such as their size, shape, binding energy, and excited state spectrum is the remit of *nuclear structure*.  We work on theoretical models which in some way or another involve wrangling the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation and the complicated nucleon-nucleon interactions into a form that allow for practical calculations to help us understand nuclear structure from a microscopic (= at the level of individual neutron and proton wave functions) level.

The basic approach in my work is the self-consistent mean field using Skyrme-type effective interactions;  from there the effects of interaction properties are explored, and approximations relaxed to go beyond the restrictions of the mean-field approach.  

The picture below shows some recent calculations of octupole excitations in even-even nuclei around <sup>208</sup>Pb

Nuclear reactions involve the interaction of nuclei with another object which could be another nucleus, or some external probe such as a photon.  The decay of nuclei in which the multiple objects are in the final state can also be considered as a kind of nuclear reaction.  Applying a time-depedent version of the mean-field methods used for structure calculations allow details of structure and reactions to be described in a single framework.  Applications include deep-inelastic reactions, Coulomb excitation, fusion and fission reactions, and a number of exotic relatives such as quasifission and fusion-fission.  

The principal code used for these calculations is published and freely available.  The latest version [Sky3d 1.1 is available from Computer Physics Communications](http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/vzbrzvyrn4.1)

## Quantum Computing

With PhD students Isaac Hobday; Lance Li; Jane Rex, with James Benstead, Jim Al-Khalili and other collaborators

Quantum computers are previously hypothetical and now realised devices which make use of properties of quantum mechanics to allow certain calculations to be achieved much more efficiently than on regular computers.  In particular, simulating many-body quantum systems (such as nuclei) is theoretically possible on quantum computers in a way that copes with the huge combinatorial increase in complexity of the problem when the number of nucleons becomes large.  

Our work is on developing quantum algorithms that are able to perform practical calculations of nuclear properties and running them on todays limited-qubit and noisy quantum computers.

The picture below shows the energy landscape of a model nuclear Hamiltonian as a function of parameters in a variational wave function ansatz.

## Other Work

As well as the main research areas mentioned above, I work on generic computational methods beyond their application just to nuclear physics or quantum computing problems;  in quantum biology and chemistry, particularly in quantum tunnelling in DNA;  in special relativity where a student project (by Evan Cryer-Jenkins) led to a paper on visualisation of Terrell rotations.

The picture below from the special relativity work shows combined distortion and redshift effects on a fast-moving cyclist as seen by a left and right eye in combination.
