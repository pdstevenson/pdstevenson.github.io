I am a Reader in the [Physics Department](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/department-physics) of the [University of Surrey](http://www.surrey.ac.uk),  head of the [Theoretical Nuclear Physics Group](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/theoretical-nuclear-physics-group), and an AWE William Penney Fellow.

My research is mainly in theoretical nuclear physics and quantum computing, with some occasional projects in quantum biology and chemsitry, and in computational methods.  

This is a new (in 2022) set of web pages for me, which should become my main personal academic set of pages, once I have got to grips with getting everything on github.  Until then my [other personal academic site](http://personal.ph.surrey.ac.uk/~phs3ps/) continues to have more information, and my [official University of Surrey Page](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/paul-stevenson) will also continue to exist.
