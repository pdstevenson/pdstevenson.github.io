I am a Reader in the [Physics Department](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/department-physics) of the [University of Surrey](http://www.surrey.ac.uk),  head of the [Theoretical Nuclear Physics Group](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/theoretical-nuclear-physics-group), and an AWE William Penney Fellow.

My research is mainly in theoretical nuclear physics and quantum computing, with some occasional projects in quantum biology and chemsitry, and in computational methods.  Further details can be found in the [Research](/research) tabs, with a full list of outputs in the [Publications](/publications) tab.
