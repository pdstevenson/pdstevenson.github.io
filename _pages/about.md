I am a Reader in the [Physics Department](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/department-physics) of the [University of Surrey](http://www.surrey.ac.uk),  head of the [Theoretical Nuclear Physics Group](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/theoretical-nuclear-physics-group), and an AWE William Penney Fellow.

This is a new (in 2022) set of web pages for me, which should become my main personal academic set of pages, once I have got to grips with getting everything on github.  Until then my [other personal academic site](http://personal.ph.surrey.ac.uk/~phs3ps/) continues to have more information, and my [official University of Surrey Page](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/paul-stevenson) will also continue to exist
