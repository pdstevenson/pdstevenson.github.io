A recent [paper by Li et al.](htttp://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1402-4896/ad664c) introduced a variance minimization quantum algorithm.  As one of their examples, they took a much-used nuclear physics case:  A one-body model of the deuteron.  Unfortunately, their presentation was a bit problematic, so I wrote a comment to submit to the journal (Physica Scripta) to try to correct the record.  The comment was rejected by the editor, so I present the comment here instead, for the record - link at end of post. I would have put it on the arXiv, but they don't publish comments of papers unless those papers are in the arXiv.

I also wrote a longer blog post about this [here](https://blogoftheisotopes.blogspot.com/2024/09/commenting-on-research.html).  This news story on my github site is more a place to give the comment a permanent URL.
