This week, we (PhD student Lance, co-supervisor Jim, and me) have published a new paper on a method of solution of non-linear coupled Schrödinger equtions on quantum computer.  
It's the continuation of [some previous work](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.109.044322) where we employed the quantum imaginary time method to solve nuclear density functional problems in a simple model.
In the new work, we wanted to make the model more realistic and less simple, and this meant solving simultaneously for multiple single particle wave functions, each of which are subject to slightly different Schrödinger equations, but which couple together through a density-depedendent term.
Rather than present this work as specifically a way to solve the nuclear physics problem, we decided to send it to a more general journal which was running a special issue on quantum computing technology in the hope of reaching a wider audience.  I guess we will see if it gets widely read and cited, but the referee, at least, agreed that it was worth publishing, at least after a round of comments / updates.
The paper does not yet have its final volume and article number designation, but is online at the [EPJ Special Topics](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjs/s11734-024-01384-z) journal site.
