I've (finally?) moved my website from the Unviersity of Surrey's personal account server to github, where I've built it on top of the "academic pages" style.  I must admit, I find it easier to write the bare HTML of my simple previous version of my professional home page, but this seems to be the future.  I intend to use this "blog" facility for research-related news stories.  See the blogger link in the side panel for my real nuclear physics blog!
