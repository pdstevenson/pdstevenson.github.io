Congratulations to Lance Li, my PhD student on the publication of his first paper.  It shows how the quantum imaginary time evolution operator can be used to solve nuclear density functional theory on a quantum computer.  Physical Review C published the paper today at [Phys. Rev. C. 109, 044322 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.109.044322).  It's open access so viewable by all.
