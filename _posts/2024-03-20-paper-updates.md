Our group has had a busy time writing up and submitting some of the work we have been doing, so I thought I'd highlight it here:

• First; the paper I mentioned in the [last post](https://pdstevenson.github.io/posts/2013/08/blog-post-2/) has now been accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. C - well done to PhD student Lance on your first paper!

• Lance has followed up that first paper with a [second one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01623) extending the method of his first paper to deal with systems in which there are multiple different single particle states in play and so the quantum algorithm developed has to solve coupled nonlinear differential equations.  So far it's just on the arXiv and we're thinking about where to submit it, and see what comments we get.

• Bharti Bhoy's first paper on our shell-model-on-quantum-computer project [is up on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15577).  We've submitted it to a special edition of New Journal of Physics, being semi-officially linked to the grant programme funding it.

• My PhD student Isaac has submitted a first [substantial paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08625) to Phys. Rev. C.  This follows up a couple of conference proceedings with prepartory work ([here](https://doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/202328416002) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2632782))

• A collaboration with Yue Shi and Nobuo Hinohara has led to [a preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12539) submitted to Comput. Phys. Commun. which describes a new C++ code implementing time-dependent density functional theory.  Yue wrote the code, and I worked closely with him on comparing term by term with my Sky3D code to ensure correctness of both codes.

• ... and finally, Joe Gibbs has [submitted a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10277) with me and his external co-supervisor Zoë Holmes in which we make use of a symmetric wave function ansatz to target the ground state in a quantum algorithm.
