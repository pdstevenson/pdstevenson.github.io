Here are some recent updates from our research group, since my last update here in September:

• Lance Li, author of the paper [mentioned in my last post](https://pdstevenson.github.io/posts/2024/11/epjspaper/) finished his PhD, submitted it, and is now working with us as a post-doc, working on quantum computing aspects of angular momentum coupling, to help understand the extent to which it makes sense to ask a quantum computer to do the labour of an $m$-scheme or $j$-scheme shell model calculation

• Joe Gibbs' paper (with me and Zoë Holmes from EPFL Lausanne) on nuclear physics wave function ansatzes for quantum computing that [I mentioned](https://pdstevenson.github.io/posts/2024/03/paper-updates/) when we submittied it to the arXiv has now been published as [Quantum Mach. Initell. 7, 14 (2025)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42484-025-00242-y).

• Grant Close, a PhD student I second-supervise with [Alexis Diaz-Torres](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/alexis-diaz-torres) has submitted a preprint to the arXiv with his calculations of carbon-carbon burning in stellar environments, using miscroscopic physics in all aspects of the calculation and showing the importance of allowing fully general geometrical pathways for the reacting nuclei: Preprint at [ArXiv:2502:11240](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11240)

• A new paper appeared last week in Physical Review Letters: [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 062502 (2025)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.062502) which deals with experimental observation of low-lying excited states in <sup>208</sup>Pb.  My colleague Esra Yüksel and our (now ex-)postdoc Abhishek contributed to the theoretical intepretation of the results, and hence are co-authors.
