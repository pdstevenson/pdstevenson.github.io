I am module coordinator for, and teach the University of Surrey modules PHY3038: Special Relativity and PHY3042: Modern Computational Techniques.  I supervise projects on the the modules PHY3002: Final Year Project (BSc), PHYM021: Research Project and Dissertation (MSc), and on the MPhys Research Year.

University of Surrey students should access course material via [SurreyLearn](http://surreylearn.surrey.ac.uk)
